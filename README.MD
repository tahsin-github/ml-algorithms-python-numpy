# Machine Learning Algorithms in Python (NumPy only).
Implementation of Machine Learning algorithms in Python using only the module Numpy.

Here, I implemented some widely used Machine Learning algorithms from scratch, without using any specialized Machine Learning Modules like SciPy or scikit-learn. For all calculation only NumPy is used.

In every implementation of algorithms there are 5 steps.

1. Loading the data.
2. Split the data to train and test data.
3. Train the model using the specific algorithm using the training data.
4. Measure the performance of the algorithm using the test data.
5. Visualization(if required).


In this repository the organization of the implementation is given in following way,

1. Codes: All the codes are given in this folder. Any one can use these codes and functions with there own data.
2. Implementation: The implementation is presented with an example dataset. Any one can easily follow these steps with the given codes.



Algorithms Presented:

1. Supervised Learning:

    a) k-nearest neighbors algorithm
    

2. Unsupervised Learning

    a) k means algorithm
